# Theme Park Simulation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Theme Park Simulation! This project is a virtual theme park experience implemented in C. Visitors can enjoy various rides, participate in trivia challenges, visit a haunted house (for those 18 and older), and purchase items from the food court. The simulation tracks the park's total revenue and provides detailed receipts for each visitor.

## Features

1. **Intro Page**
   - The simulation begins with an introduction page that sets the theme and mood for the virtual theme park experience.

2. **Rides**
   - Visitors can queue up for various rides.
   - If visitors don't get a chance to ride in the first round, they will be asked again once the rides are empty, ensuring everyone gets a turn.

3. **Haunted House**
   - Only visitors aged 18 and above are allowed entry.
   - Visitors under 18 are not permitted in the haunted house.

4. **Trivia Challenge**
   - Visitors can participate in a trivia challenge.
   - Correct answers allow visitors to surpass the haunted house door and experience a creepy event.
   - There are four doors to pass through.
   - Visitors who answer all questions correctly win a prize.

5. **Food Court**
   - The menu is retrieved from a CSV file.
   - Visitors can purchase as many items as they want in whatever quantities they desire.
   - At the end of their purchase, a receipt is generated detailing their items and total cost.
   - The total revenue of the theme park is stored in a revenue CSV file.

## How to Compile and Run the Simulation

1. **Setup**
   - Ensure you have a C compiler (such as `gcc`) installed on your machine.
   - Place the menu CSV file (`menu.csv`) and the revenue CSV file (`revenue.csv`) in the project directory.

2. **Compiling the Simulation**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Compile the code using the provided Makefile:
     ```bash
     make
     ```

3. **Running the Simulation**
   - Run the compiled executable:
     ```bash
     ./theme_park_simulation
     ```

4. **Navigation**
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the different sections of the theme park.
   - Input your choices when prompted to experience the various rides, participate in the trivia challenge, visit the haunted house, and purchase items from the food court.

## CSV File Formats

### Menu CSV (`menu.csv`)
This file should contain the menu items available at the food court. Each row represents an item with the following columns:
- `Item Name`: The name of the food item.
- `Price`: The price of the item.

### Revenue CSV (`revenue.csv`)
This file keeps track of the total revenue generated by the theme park. It contains the following columns:
- `Date`: The date of the revenue entry.
- `Total Revenue`: The total revenue for that date.

Example:
```csv
Date,Total Revenue
2024-06-12,1500.00
```

## Notes

- Make sure the CSV files are correctly formatted and placed in the appropriate directory.
- The simulation is designed to be interactive and user-friendly. Follow the prompts carefully to fully enjoy the virtual theme park experience.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more rides and attractions.
- Implement a more complex queuing system for rides.
- Enhance the trivia challenge with more questions and categories.
- Add more detailed reports and analytics for revenue and visitor statistics.
